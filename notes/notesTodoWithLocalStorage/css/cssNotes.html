  <strong>TextDecoration</strong>
  <strong> Css Display property</strong>
  <p>paragraphs are bolock elements and take whole width</p>
  <p>span, img, anchor tags are common inline elements and take only as much required.
    we cannot change width of inline elements but we can change width of block elements.
    By setting display style property to inline they let next elements to follow them on the 
    same line. ('display': 'inline'). 
    setting display: 'inline-block' makes element have both properties. i.e we can set their width
    and also treat them as inline elements.

  <p>using span: <span style="color: red;">spanned part</span> non spanned part</p>

  <strong style="font-size: 25px; color: brown;"> Hiding visibility</strong>
  <p>This word is displayed</p>
  <p>This <span style="display: none;">word</span> is not displayed. "display": "none"</p>
  <p>This <span style="visibility: hidden;"> word</span> is not displayed "visibility":"hidden"</p>
  <p>setting display to none removes the element from being displayed. while visibility set to 
    hidden just hides with a visible empty space 
  </p>

  <strong>Css positioning </strong>
  <p>1) order of elements come from the html code.</p>
  <p>2) childern sit on parents</p>
  <div style="background-color: yellow ;">
    <p>this is a child para that sits on the top of a div parent element whose background
      is yellow. while this <span style="color: red;">word</span> written in a span element sits on its parent
      p element 
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>3) positioning elements: elements are usually positioned by the default layout. 
    These have position: static. By setting it to relative it can be moved relative to
    itself. moving an element by relative positioning doesnt move or effect other elements. The element 
    that is moved through relative positioning moves by leaving empty space at its original position. 
    "top": 20px in relative positioning sets 20px top margin from the current position. 
  </p>
  <p>The below images position is set to relative and is positioned 30px from left</p>
  <img style="position: relative; left: 30px" src="./images/boxModel.png" alt="">
  <p> we can set properties like top, bottom, left, right when position: relative</p>
  <strong style="font-size: 25px;">Absolute positioning</strong>
  <p>4) Through absolute positioning we can change the coordinates(top, left, botom, right)
    relative to its parent element. Unlike relative positioning the original gost position is deleted.
    This can affect the layout of other elements. Like the deleted space in the layout can be taken by
    other surrounding elements


    
  </p>
  <div class="AbsolutePositioning" style="background-color: yellow;">
    <p>this is a parent div and the below image is positioned with "absolute" and 
      is moved relative to its div parent 300px with left = 300px
    </p>
    <img id = 'img4' src="./images/boxModel.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>........</p>
  </div>
  <p>In <strong>Relative positioning</strong> the element is moved wrt where it should have been.
  In <strong>Absolute positioning</strong> the element is moved wrt its parent</p>

  <p class="paraClassGreen">sample paragraph</p>
  <p class="paraClassGreen demo">we can have only 1 id as a selector
     but we can have multiple classes to one selector as this one. This paragraph
     has two classes 'paraClassGreen' and 'demo'. The above pragraph has only one 
     cass paraClassGreen while this paragraph has both paraClassGreen and demo.

     Classes and id's are more specific selectors than tag selectors. 
     Tag selectors properties can be over ridden by class or id 
     selectors. Id's are unique throughout the html</p>
