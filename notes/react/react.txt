// JSX
* const element = <p>abc {JavaScript Expression}</p>
* JSX is converted to JavaScript.
* <div className="sidebar" /> --------> React.createElement('div', {'className': 'sideBar'})
* components begin with capital Letters unlike html elements say <div> that starts with small letters. 
* JSX <Component /> expression expects Component to be in the scope. 'Component' tag is compiled to its named reference

// .....................................
// components and props:
* When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and 
children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

function Welcome (props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}

const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
const element = <Welcome name='props'>
root.render(element);

* If no value if passed to a prop its default value is true
* spread props
    function App1(props) {
        return <Greeting {...props}/>
    }

* select one and spread others
    function App2(props) {
        const {kind, ...others} = props;
        return <button className={kind} {...others} />
    }

//............................
// composing components:                          // helps reusing components
function Welcome (props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
        <Welcome name='sara'>
        <Welcome name='worls'>
        </div>
    )
}

* All react components must act like pure functions wrt their props

// State and Life-cycle // https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/reactjs-state#:~:text=HackerEarthEXPLORE%20COURSE-,What%20Is%20'State'%20in%20ReactJS%3F,%2C%20the%20component%20re%2Drenders.
* state is similar to props but it is private and fully controlled by props
* The state is a built-in react object used to contain data about the component
* a change in state re-renders the component. State modifies with user actions, event-listeners etc.
* this.setState() can change value of state object.

// MOUNTING:
// componentWillMount():
* This function is called right before we mount the component on the DOM. So after this method executes,
 the component gets mounted on the DOM. It executes this method before the first render of the React 
 application. So all the tasks that have to be done before the component mounts are defined in this method.

// render():
*This function mounts the component on the browser. 

// componentDidMount():
* We invoke this function right after the component is mounted on the DOM i.e., this function gets called once 
after the render() function is executed for the first time. Generally, in React applications, we do the 
API calls within this method.

// UPDATING:
* setState():
* This function can be called explicitly at any moment. This function is used to update the state of a component.

* shouldComponentUpdate():
* This function is called before rendering a component and tells React whether it should update the component
 on receiving new props or state. It takes the new Props and new State as the arguments and returns whether
  or not to re-render the component by returning either True or False.

* componentWillUpdate():
* This function is called once before the render() function is executed after the update of State or Props.

* componentDidUpdate():
* This function is called once after the render() function is executed after the update of State or Props.

* componentWillUnmount():
* This function is called once before we remove the component from the page and this marks the end of the life-cycle.
